# readme.md for risk-register


This Excel risk register uses a simplified version of FAIR, NIST, and Carnegie-Mellon risk methodologies. This version is easier to use, at the expense of thoroughness and accuracy of calculations. However, this register is suitable for most small-to-moderate sized organizations.

The general concept for this register is to equate cybersecurity risks in dollar terms: annual loss expectancy (ALE).

The impact of losses are categorized into four traunches:
1. Catastrophic (could put you out of business)
2. Large (could significantly disrupt your business)
3. Moderate (painful, but tolerable)
4. Negligible (annoying, but manageable)

The magnitude/scale of each traunch is based on your organization's annual sales (or annual expenses). As your organization grows, the dollar impact of cybersecurity events also increases.

Two types of ALEs are calculated:
- Inherent ALE: Losses expected IF NO CONTROLS EXIST
- Residual ALE: Losses expected AFTER CONTROLS ARE APPLIED

Space is provided for up to 200 risks.
Each risk can have up to 4 controls to mitigate Inherent ALE -> Residual ALE.

The desired goal is for organizations to focus on the highest residual ALE items (which are color-coded) before addressing lower risks.

Note that the actual dollar amounts are only used to rank risks, they do not accurately predict the amount of risk an organization faces. In addition, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE to simply add all the residual ALEs to arrive at total cybersecurity risk.
